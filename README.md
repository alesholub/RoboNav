# RoboNav
RoboNav = visual navigation for mobile robot (OpenCV + BlueTerm) [author's email is aholub@centrum.cz]

**Notes:**
- application tries to follow defined GPS waypoints and stay on road (by avoiding road edges)
- application sends bluetooth commands to robot (see below) [so you need a bluetooth enabled robot]
- RoboNav.apk is targeted for Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread (API level 10) [it also runs in higher versions of Android]
- RoboNav.apk requires OpenCV Manager installed in your Android system (app uses OpenCV Library 2.4.9)
- for proper function, you have to put map file RoboNavMap.txt (see map format below) into SD card root
- for conversion from OSM file to RoboNavMap.txt is my online tool at http://www.vmoste.cz/RoboNav/maps/index.php 
- application at startup tries to connect to a paired and active bluetooth device nearby
- default screen orientation is portrait (changeable at preferences)
- you can define GPS waypoints directly on-screen at input mode 1 (long touch define waypoint with expected payload drop)
- operational logs are created automatically at root of SD card

**Active buttons (corners) on screen (in portrait orientation):**
- D (top left) = debug on/off (debug screen messages)
- S (top center) = save (to preferences and to RoboNavPath.txt)
- I (top right) = input mode (0/red = run, 1/green = define waypoints [then tap "S" button to save defined path to RoboNavPath.txt])
- M/V (bottom right) = mute/voice switch (voice output is generated by TTS) [it reads sent commands and other changes]
- bottom left corner = search mode switch (incremental)
 - 0 = manual control
 - 1 = RobotemRovne
 - 2 = RoboOrienteering (not yet fully implemented)
 - 3 = RoboTour
 - 4 = color avoid
 - 5 = color follow
 - 6 = line detection (not yet fully implemented)

- more preferences are available at bluetooth terminal (after quitting of visual navigation by standard "back" button in Android)

Required map format (for RoboNavMap.txt) [example]:
0 49.3092137 14.1513494 0
1 49.309096 14.1504934 0
2 49.309726 14.1484146 0
3 49.3096508 14.1486873 0
4 49.3095187 14.1490986 0
0 1
0 2
2 3
3 4
(first few linas are in format "id latitude longitude 0" => nodes)
(last/shorter lines are in format "id1 id2" => edges)

Supported serial/bluetooth commands for robot:
s = stop
f or w = forward
b or x = backward
l or a = left
r or d = right
y = straight
h = slightly left
k = slightly right
p = payload drop
0 - 9 = speed (0 - 9 [max])
t = turn (reverse course)

Expected serial/bluetooth telemetry from robot (about once per second):

To-do:
- automatic routing (find optimal path in the map)
- more robust road detection (merging of multiple detection methods)
- navigation through the crossroads
- simulation of the path (reading of the itinerary)
- complete RoboOrienteering navigation (detection of orange cone)
- better displaying of the state
- GPS odometry
- visual detection and avoiding of obstacles
- video recording (to SD card)
- wifi telemetry and video streaming
- probability and artificial intelligence
